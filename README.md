*** Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN**
This project is a deep learning model that classifies traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

*** Dataset**
- Training data is organized into folders under Train folder
- Test images can be placed in Test folder

*** Model Architecture**
2 Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Output layer
Categorical crossentropy loss + Adam optimizer

***  Output**
 Accuracy graph is shown after training
Prediction shows class number for the test image
